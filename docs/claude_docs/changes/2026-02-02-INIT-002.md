# INIT-002: Create Individual Agent Configuration Files

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Change ID** | INIT-002 |
| **Date** | 2026-02-02 |
| **Agent** | Setup (Manual) |
| **Status** | Complete |
| **Reviewed By** | N/A (Configuration) |
| **Security Cleared** | N/A (Documentation only) |

---

## Context

Created individual agent configuration files for Claude Code to recognize and invoke as specialized agents. Each agent has complete instructions, chain of thought process, chunking rules, documentation requirements, and output formats.

## Changes Made

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.claude/agents/master-architect.md` | Created | Opus agent - final authority, escalations |
| `.claude/agents/infrastructure.md` | Created | Terraform, AWS, networking, Docker |
| `.claude/agents/detection-engineering.md` | Created | Zeek, Suricata, Sigma, Wazuh, YARA rules |
| `.claude/agents/ml-ai-pipeline.md` | Created | ML models, training, MLOps, AI agents |
| `.claude/agents/backend.md` | Created | Lambda functions, APIs, data processing |
| `.claude/agents/frontend.md` | Created | React dashboards, D3.js visualizations |
| `.claude/agents/cti.md` | Created | Threat intel, IoC schemas, APT tracking |
| `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` | Created | Quality gate - slop, residual code |
| `.claude/agents/security.md` | Created | Final gate - vulnerabilities, OT safety |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Updated | Added links to individual agent files |

## Agent Summary

| Agent | Prefix | Model | Primary Responsibility |
|-------|--------|-------|------------------------|
| Master Architect | ARCH | opus | Final decisions, unblock other agents |
| Infrastructure | INFRA | sonnet | AWS, Terraform, networking |
| Detection Engineering | DET | sonnet | Detection rules, Pyramid of Pain |
| ML/AI Pipeline | ML | sonnet | Models, training, AI agents |
| Backend | BACK | sonnet | Lambdas, APIs, data processing |
| Frontend | FRONT | sonnet | React, D3.js, dashboards |
| CTI | CTI | sonnet | Threat intel, indicators |
| Code Reviewer | REV | sonnet | Quality gate, all code |
| Security | SEC | sonnet | Final gate, OT safety |

## Verification

- [x] All 9 agent files created in `.claude/agents/`
- [x] Each agent has: Chain of thought, Chunking rules, Documentation requirements
- [x] Each agent references `docs/claude_docs/INDEX.md` workflow
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with links to agent files
- [x] Consistent format across all agents

## For Other Agents

**To invoke an agent:**
1. Read the agent's `.md` file from `.claude/agents/[name].md`
2. Use the Task tool with `model: sonnet` (or `opus` for Master Architect)
3. Include the full agent prompt from the file
4. Agent will follow its documented chain of thought

**Documentation workflow:**
- Every agent creates change files in `docs/claude_docs/changes/`
- Every agent updates INDEX.md after completing work
- Change IDs are sequential per agent (e.g., INFRA-001, INFRA-002)
