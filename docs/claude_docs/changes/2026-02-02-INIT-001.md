## Context

The RobotLab OT/ICS Security Platform requires a structured documentation system to track all agent work. This ensures:
- Single source of truth for all changes
- Clear visibility into what changed and why
- Easy handoffs between agents
- Audit trail for human review

## For Other Agents

**Key Points:**
1. Always check INDEX.md before starting work
2. Always update INDEX.md after completing work (add row to top of table)
3. Always create a change file in `changes/YYYY-MM-DD-AGENT-NNN.md`
4. Always append to CHANGELOG.md
5. Change IDs are sequential per agent (e.g., INFRA-001, INFRA-002)

**File Naming Convention:**
```
changes/YYYY-MM-DD-AGENT-NNN.md
Example: changes/2025-02-03-INFRA-001.md
```
